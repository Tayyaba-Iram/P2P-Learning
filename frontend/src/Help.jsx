      <p>
        To schedule a session, first click the <strong>"Schedule Session"</strong> button on the dashboard.
        Then provide the topic, date, start time, and end time.
      </p>
      <p>
        After that, choose a payment method:
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Cash:</strong> Provide the instructorâ€™s details and enter the payment amount.
            This amount will be transferred to the system's account but will only be forwarded
            to the instructor after the session is successfully conducted. Without making this payment, your session will not be scheduled.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Food:</strong> Enter the food brand name, the ordered item, and upload a receipt picture as proof.
            Once all information is provided, your session will be scheduled with food as the payment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once the session is scheduled, it will appear on your calendar on the selected date.
        You will also have the option to delete the session from the calendar if needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        After scheduling, send the session link to your instructor peer via the "Chat" button on the dashboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the session time, both of you should click the <strong>"Conduct Session"</strong> button and join the session using the shared link.
        You can copy and use this link to enter the session.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the session ends, you will be asked to provide feedback about the session.
      </p>
